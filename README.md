Fireworks
=========
---------
We all love fireworks, don't we? And since Minecraft: PE & Win10 Edition don't have fireworks... I added them! Fire Charges have been replaced with magnificent exploding balls of colour to light up your night sky!

Features:
---------

  **Fireworks** â€” The main feature of this Minecraft: PE & Win10 Edition add-on is obviously the fireworks themselves! The default Fire Charges' texture have been replaced with a firework, and it colourfully and automatically explodes a small amount of time after being launched into the air.

  **Ghasts & Blazes** - Because of this, the way ghasts and blazes attack you is a bit more... interesting. They will shoot what looks like fireworks at you, but watch out - it'll still explode like normal!

Downloading & Installing:
-------------------------

  **Downloading** - Go to https://thedragonring.me/projects, find Fireworks and click the "Download - MCAddon" button.

  **Installing** - Open the downloaded file in Minecraft: PE or Win10 Edition (depending on what you are using), then go to the settings of the world you want to use the add-on on, go to behaviour packs and enable the one called Fireworks - the texture pack will be automatically enabled if you do this.

  _This add-on is for Minecraft: PE & Win10 Edition only, it will not work on Minecraft: PC & Mac Editions._
