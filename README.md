# Fireworks
*We all love fireworks, don't we? And since Minecraft: PE & Win10 Edition don't have fireworks... I added them! Fire Charges have been replaced with magnificent exploding balls of colour to light up your night sky!*

*NOTE: Since the 1.2 update fireworks have been added, removing the need for this add-on. It has now been archived.*

### Usage
----------
To use Fireworks, simply download the `fireworks.mcaddon` file and open it in Minecraft.

### Features
-------------

- **Fireworks** â€” The main feature of this Minecraft: PE & Win10 Edition add-on is obviously the fireworks themselves! The default Fire Charges' texture have been replaced with a firework, and it colourfully and automatically explodes a small amount of time after being launched into the air.

- **Ghasts & Blazes** - Because of this, the way ghasts and blazes attack you is a bit more... interesting. They will shoot what looks like fireworks at you, but watch out - it'll still explode like normal!

### Other Details
----------------
Fireworks was originally made to add fireworks to the Minecraft: Pocket & Win10 Editions (it won't work with Minecraft: Java Edition), around January-February 2017. It is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE).
